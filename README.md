# Complex logic mock task solution

1. All input and output .csv files can be found in a Google Drive folder:
   **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hN5ns-xQHT4LP5zsQNUPbcxccrHPSoH2?usp=drive_link**
   
2. Files to be executed are in **'small', 'medium' and 'big'** folders of this repository. Each folder contains **.ipynb and .py** files and it doesn't matter which one to run (but running a python file seems to be a little faster than running a jupyter notebook). Only pandas and numpy libraries are used.

3. To run a .py or .ipynb file, corresponding 'user_data.csv' and 'market_data.csv' should be located in the same folder. The output files will also appear in that folder.

4. Code differs a little because the larger input data size is, the more memory optimisation is done.
